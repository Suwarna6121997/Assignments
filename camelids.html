<h1>Camelids</h1>
<p>The four Hamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and strictly herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.
They have a three chambered rathe than four chambered digestive tract;an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile, and an 
isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still(from
